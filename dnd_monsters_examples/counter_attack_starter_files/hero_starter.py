# Pseudocode:

# 1. Connect to Kafka Consumer for the 'monster-damage' topic.
#    - Define Kafka Consumer configurations.
#    - Subscribe to 'monster-damage' topic.

# 2. For each incoming message (monster) from Kafka:
#    - Parse the message to extract monster details (e.g., monster type, location, damage).
#    - Determine which hero class is best suited to counter the monster based on its location (continent).
#    - Optionally: Calculate the chance for a critical hit for the chosen hero.

# 3. Send the chosen hero details (e.g., hero class, damage) to Kafka 'hero-damage' topic.
#    - Serialize hero details into a suitable format (e.g., JSON).
#    - Publish the serialized message to 'hero-damage' topic using Kafka Producer.

# 4. (Optional) Display the chosen hero and the monster it's combating in a user-friendly manner (e.g., console output, GUI).

# TODO: Implement Kafka Consumer and Producer functionality.
# TODO: Implement hero selection logic based on incoming monster details.
# TODO: Implement optional critical hit calculation for hero.
# TODO: Implement data serialization for sending hero details to Kafka.
